# Lambda Tutorial

I built this tutorial on lambda because of my original struggles getting lambda
set up and working. this covers:

* set up with zappa
* vpc to connect to a mysql RDS instance on amazon
* RDS persistence and querying through the lambda function
* CORs setup
* simple security

The tutorial should be done by checking out these branches and going through the
readmes in this order

 * hello-world
 * routing
 * rds-integration
 * database-requests

I have done my best to keep this simple and short, please open any issues
if you have trouble with an explanation or get stuck on a step and I will
work hard to solve those.
